Bayesian Edge Screening and Structure Selection for the Ising Model

Bayesian edge screening and structure selection for the Ising 
model using continuous spike-and-slab prior distributions. A mixture of 
two normal prior distributions are stipulated on the interaction effects to
model edge inclusion and exclusion. A standard normal prior is stipulated 
on the main effects. Hyperparameters for the normal mixture are 
automatically determined by fixing the type-1 error. The details of this 
procedure can be found in Marsman, Huth, Waldorp, and Ntzoufras (2020). The prior 
distribution on the structures (configurations of edges) is either uniform,
or uniform on structure complexity (Beta(1,1)-Binomial). The EM variable 
selection approach of Ro"\U+010D"kov"\U+00E1" and George (Journal of the 
American Statistical Association, 109(506):828-846, 2014) is used for edge 
screening and the SSVS approach of George and McCulloch (Journal of the 
American Statistical Association, 88(423):881-889, 1993) is used for 
structure selection.
